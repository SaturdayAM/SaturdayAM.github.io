## On Graphs ##
Continuing on from our discussion about trees a couple of blog posts ago,
we will now discuss their superset, **graphs**.

Trees are a type of graph, but the converse is not true. 
Graphs are a collection of nodes with edges connecting some of them.
However, for a tree, there will be no cycles amongst these connections.

A **cycle** in graph theory is when a vertex (node) is reachable from 
itself through its edges to other nodes. 


{% highlight javascript %}
            [8]        //A cycle: 8 can reach itself
           /   \ 
          /     \
        [3]-----[10]  
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight javascript %}

      //A tree: contains no cycles         //A graph
                                           
            [8]                            [8]        [7]
           /   \                            | \        |
          /     \                           |  \       |
         [3]    [10]                       [3]--[10]--[11] 
        /  \      \                             
       /    \      \                           
      [1]   [6]     [14]                    
{% endhighlight %}

Graphs can have a number of properties:
* They can be **directed** or **undirected**. In a directed graph,
  think of each edge as having a one-way flow. In a non-directed
  graph each edge flows both ways.
* If there is a path between every pair of vertices, a graph
  is considered a **connected graph**. 
* A graph that has no cycles is called an *acyclic graph*

## Representing Graphs ##
In the context of programming, the two most common ways of representing a graph are
the **adjacency list** and the **adjacency matrix**.
* In an **adjacency list**, one has a list containing the nodes of the graph, with each node
linking to a list of all its adjacent vertices.
* In an **adjacency matrix**, a NxN matrix (N is the number of nodes in the graph) is used to
represent the graph. Each value stored at matrix[i][j] denotes whether or not an edge exists
from node [i] to [j] (i.e. 1 or 0). 

Below is an example for representing the following graph: 

{% highlight javascript %}
                      
  // Undirected Graph          //list                  //Matrix
                                                       
  [0]                        [0]->[1]->[2]            //    [0] [1] [2] [3]         
   | \                       [1]->[0]->[2]            // [0] 0   1   1   0
   |  \                      [2]->[1]->[3]->[0]       // [1] 1   0   1   0   
  [1]--[2]--[3]              [3]->[2]                 // [2] 1   1   0   1  
                                                      // [3] 0   0   1   0    
{% endhighlight %}
