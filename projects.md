Below are some of the personal projects that I've recently
made! Please note, I am still in the process of deploying
these projects online, if they are web applications.


## Reactive Games ##
**[Reactive Games](https://github.com/SaturdayAM/reactive-games)** - A single page web 
application that allows for users to play various 2D games with account functionality.
These include "Snake", "2048", and a dungeon crawler game created using the Phaser JS
library. [Backend API](https://github.com/SaturdayAM/reactive-games-backend) built with 
Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL.

application that allows for users to track crypto currency data as well as create
an account and live chat on a chatroom. Implemented with Action Cable (chat room 
functionality), Ruby on Rails ([back end](https://github.com/SaturdayAM/crypto-home)), 
and the D3 JS library (chart plotting). Live fetches crypto data from the CryptoCompare API.
