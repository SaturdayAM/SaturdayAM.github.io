I'm a technology enthusiast and programmer looking to grow as a developer. I have a passion for
web technologies, big data, and machine learning. My interest in coding began while dabbling with
macro scripts for a popular MMO in high school. An ongoing experience of building applications and seeing ideas 
come to fruition continues to deepen my appreciation for code.
